<pre>
    This project is a deployable Docker API built with TypeScript that offers easy extensibility by adding schemas, view models, and controllers using Swagger UI. It features automated documentation generation and route loading based on function decorators. It includes both HTTP and HTTPS functionality and supports all request types. The base server is an Express server, and it uses TypeORM for the database connection with a custom 'Database' class using a singleton pattern. The Docker container also includes its own MariaDB server.
